# hello world ðŸŒ±

I have two nicknames; for those who don't know me might go by my first name Annisa, but you can call me Pew.

I'm currently working at [SIRCLO](https://www.sirclo.com/) as an Associate Frontend Engineer. I can *speak* TypeScript and React too. I like reading and learning, but believe me I'd prefer surfing on the the internet. I'm so awkward in real life.
